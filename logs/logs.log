Feature: I wanted to have a website that would automatically display a short joke in the middle of the page. Click the "Get Another Joke" button to toggle the display of a joke.
As a website owner,
I want to have a feature that automatically displays a short joke on the homepage
So that I can entertain and engage visitors to my website.

Scenario 1: Displaying a joke on the homepage
Given a visitor arrives at the website
When the homepage is loaded
Then a short joke is immediately displayed in the center of the page

Scenario 2: Getting another joke
Given a visitor is on the homepage and a joke is already displayed
When the visitor clicks the "Get Another Joke" button
Then the current joke disappears and a new joke is displayed in the middle of the page

Scenario 3: Avoiding consecutive jokes
Given a visitor is on the homepage and has just read a joke
When the visitor clicks the "Get Another Joke" button multiple times
Then each time, a new joke different from the previous one is displayed

["Scenario 1: When a visitor arrives at the website, they will immediately see a short joke displayed in the center of the homepage. This joke is automatically presented upon the website's loading without any action required from the visitor.", 'Scenario 2: \nIf a visitor is already on the homepage and a joke is currently being displayed, they have the option to view a different joke. By clicking the "Get Another Joke" button, the current joke will disappear from the screen and a new joke will take its place in the middle of the page.', 'Scenario 3: \nIn a situation where a visitor is on the homepage and has just read a joke, they can click the "Get Another Joke" button multiple times to view different jokes. However, the system is designed in such a way that the same joke will not be displayed consecutively. This means that every time the visitor clicks the button, they will always see a new joke that is different from the one they just read.']

Sitemap:
- Homepage: Displays a short joke in the center of the page and has a "Get Another Joke" button.
  - getAnotherJoke(): Function to fetch and display a new joke when the button is clicked.

----------------Visual_design_template_generation---------------

The homepage template has a unified design, with all elements visually belonging together. The main heading "Welcome to the Joke Website" is placed at the top, indicating its importance through hierarchy. The joke container is centered on the page, creating balance. The joke text is displayed within the container, with enough white space around it to reduce noise and increase readability. The "Get Another Joke" button is placed below the joke, indicating its subordinate position. The button stands out through contrast, with a different color and larger size compared to the joke text. The scale is demonstrated by the difference in size between the heading, joke text, and button. The dominance is achieved by making the joke container the focal point, with the button being subordinate. Overall, the template effectively incorporates the principles of unity, gestalt, space, hierarchy, balance, contrast, scale, and dominance.

I'm sorry, but your request is a bit unclear. The current code already fetches a new joke when the "Get Another Joke" button is clicked. Could you please provide more details about the changes you want to make?
